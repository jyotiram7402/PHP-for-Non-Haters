Introduction to PHP
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open-source scripting language designed for web development. It runs on the server side and is used to create dynamic web pages and applications.

Key Features of PHP:
Server-side scripting: PHP code executes on the server before sending the output to the browser.
Embedded in HTML: PHP can be integrated directly within HTML files.
Cross-platform: Runs on various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Supports databases: Works with MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more.
Open-source and free: PHP is free to use with a large developer community.

Basic PHP Syntax:

A PHP file has a .php extension.
PHP code is written inside <?php ... ?> tags.
Statements end with a semicolon (;).

Example: Hello World in PHP

<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
?>

This code prints Hello, World! on the web page.
